## Overview

***ExecutivePro*** is a desktop app for Human Resource managers to manage their employee information, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, EP can get your employee management tasks done **faster** than traditional GUI apps.

  (return all employees whose details match any part of **all** inputted keywords).

in addition to searching based on their full name.
